## 🛠 High-Level Customization

### Data Customization
- All portfolio data is sourced from a file named `app-data.enum.ts`. Use your editor’s search shortcut to locate this file.
- Modify any section by updating the corresponding variable object in this file. To understand the details you can add to each section, refer to the predefined interfaces.

### Icons
- Icons used in the project are from [Simple Icons](https://simpleicons.org/). Visit their website to find and download icons along with their themes.

### Splash Logo
- The initial splash logo animation is not customizable but can be turned off from the `app-data.enum.ts` file.
- To create a custom splash logo:
  1. Use **Figma** or **Adobe Illustrator** to design an SVG.
  2. Animate it using [SVG Artista](https://svgartista.net/).
